In this topic, we'll see how to decompose the solution of a particular problem into functions.
Functional decomposition is simply a process of decomposing the problem into several functions. Each function does a particular task and we can perform these functions in a row to get the results we need.

When we look at a problem, we need to think about which actions we may want to repeat multiple times or, alternatively, perform separately. This is how we can get the desired functions. Let's look at our ATM simulation again and figure out which steps can be turned into separate functions.
